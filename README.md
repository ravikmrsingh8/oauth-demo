# OAuth2.0 in Action with Spring Boot 
## OAuth2.0
OAuth 2.0 is a <b>delegation protocol</b>, a means of letting someone who controls a resource allow a software application to access that resource on their behalf <b>without impersonating</b> them. 

The application requests authorization from the owner of the resource and receives tokens that it can use to access the resource. This all happens without the application needing to impersonate the person who controls the resource

<pre>
<b>RFC 6749 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749</b>
<i>
The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
